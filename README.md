# 3D Reconstruction from Multiple 2D Images  without Camera Calibration
This project presents a prototyping tool that creates a 3D model out of several different 
images taken with a consumer camera retrieving a specific object. It represents a 
significant ambit of Computer Vision for different applications, for example: robot 
route, object recognition and scene understanding, 3D modeling and animation, 
mechanical control and clinical analysis. Recovering the lost dimension from just 2D 
images has been the goal of multiview stereo, which have been extensively investigated 
for many years. The images of the object can be obtained in two ways: by using multiple 
cameras at fixed angles or single camera and varying the angles. 
Different approaches has been used in order to solve this problem based on geometric 
perspective, voxelisation, surface-based algorithm, shape-from-silhoutte methods or 
deep learning. This study proposes a mixture of image-based reconstruction based on 
binocular stereo view with the simulation of a stereo system and aims to partially 
reconstruct the 3D shape of the object using a single camera and various angles 
approach.

**NOTE:** This project is a prototype that concerns a specific study carried out a few years ago. It is right to underline that today there are much more efficient solutions.
The published code does not include user-side pre-configuration, but can be modified for some testing. Libraries may be deprecated.
